		<p> This project is to develop an application that assists students with learning difficulties to understand the assessment tasks they are given. This is important for students with difficulties in comprehending instructions and is also useful for schools, particularly those that who have a large number of students. It functions by the student using an E-form template and then displaying the information in various sways to support learning needs, for example, smaller paragraphs for easy reading, or a pink or blue background if necessary. It will be created as an enhancement to existing software that many students already use. </p>

		<p> There are often times when I struggle to understand instructions on assessment tasks. Even through all I have to do is break it down into little pieces, I procrastinate because I do not know the right questions to ask myself that will lead to little pieces, so I don’t start.  Even though I have been working on this for years, the expectations have gotten harder, so I still feel the same overwhelm as I did years ago. </p>

		<p> Unfortunately, this means I end up with less time to do my assignments, and I become stressed and feel less motivated and it goes around and around. And that is just one assessment, when I have lots of different assessments to do for different subjects, I am really difficult to live with. </p>

		<p> I want to be able to work out smaller, more achievable steps that I need to do in order to complete all of my assignments. So that I do not feel overwhelmed, and I can better manage my time. Then I would be less stressed and can do each step to a higher standard. </p>

		<p> It would be useful to not re-invent the wheel and instead enhance a program that schools, like mine and many other schools use, called ‘Day Map’.  There are many project management and process mapping tools, however I would like to tailor these types of programs to this particular problem, because I think a lot of people have the same problem as I do.  </p>

		<p> Not understanding what to do to complete an assignment amongst priorities can make you feel stressed, stupid, and you may think, “I can’t do this.” A way to counter this is to divide all the assessment instructions into smaller paragraphs making the assessment easier to read.  For example, if a student who needs help from a parent or tutor for their work, the helper can use the application to support them and help them keep track of their progress. </p>

		<p> I realise this is a visual solution for someone who is a visual learner. Therefore, this project would be awesome if it was to tackle even one aspect of this problem and develop an interface that can be tailored to auditory, kinaesthetic and logical learning styles. </p>

		<p> An application that can interpret the quality of input into an E-form that the application can then read and provide suggestions for students would be very useful. For example, the teacher creates an assessment and puts it into E-Form, then uploads it to the application. On the students end, they can download the entire E-form and either read it themselves, or click buttons in the application that can answer common questions, such as, “Where do I look for ideas?” or “When is the assessment due?”. The application would also be tracking progress on all tasks. </p>

		<p> This is important and useful for students who have a harder time looking at text information or have trouble with learning without a teacher or family member to help them. With an application like this, students can become more independent in understanding their work, and self-directed learners. </p>

		<p> To create this application, it would need to link into applications that already exist; it would need to add to applications/websites like ‘Day Map’, a school management system, or the R.M.I.T. website. We would need to ask the developers of the targeted system to consider our application for its students who struggle with understanding their work. After that, the application would need to have an overview of what it does and how it works, then it would need to be built in with the same coding language as the application it’s going to add to. It would also need to be tested to see if it has any errors, and if so, they would need to be fixed, and then it can be published. </p>

		<p> Personally, I don’t have any application building skills and I am not an expert in project management. However, what I can do is provide ideas that can aid in the final application. To make the application, I would need to ask the developers what coding they have used for their application and how they want it to be formatted and programmed. The developers would then use the application ideas, program it, and then update it to their application. </p>

		<p> The outcome of continually using this application can result in a student learning how to break down information. It can also teach students how to notice patterns in texts of information, where the topic of a paragraph starts and ends, what is the most important part to acknowledge, etc. Over time, it can become a norm in the development of educational and/or managerial applications. </p>
