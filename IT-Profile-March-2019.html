		<p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Jean-Pierre Naboudet</span> <br> <br> Student Identification: s3794442 </br> </br> E-mail: jeanpierrenaboudet@gmail.com </p>

		<p> Born in Sydney to my Australian / South African mother and my French father.  Other than coding and music I speak English. My hobby is playing the flute, and I have grown up playing with musical groups such as orchestras, flute ensembles, and bands. I am Year 11 at high school and am doing this subject as IT is not offered at my school. This year we moved from the Central Coast NSW to Adelaide and the process has not been easy. </p>

		<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> One Paragraph Questions </p>

		<p> 1.	What is your interest in IT? When did it start? What started your interest? What are your experiences? </p>

		<p> In early high school I chose ICT as electives and I was introduced to different areas of IT. First was robotics and how to use modules to program, next was A.I. and Scratch which both use a similar programming style.  Then I learnt how to use HTML and CSS. I have been intrigued by the different programming styles and their applications in the world ever since. </p>

		<p> 2.	What makes IT interesting for you? </p>

		<p> IT has a vast array of purposes. It can be useful for making long distance surgery by operating surgical robots or, to apply for a job. Along with its functions, there are many different forms of code and they are quite versatile.  For example, python can be used to make complex systems or mechanisms, and also in factory processes or business applications. </p>

		<p> 3.	Why did you begin to study at R.M.I.T? </p>

		<p> I began to study at R.M.I.T in order to broaden my knowledge on IT; I want a better understanding it and to become inspired to work towards a career in a field of IT. </p>

		<p> 4.	What do you expect to learn from this course? </p>

		<p> From this course, I expect to learn more about the IT industry, where I can fit in, and types of work that I might be interested in doing. </p>

		<p> 5.	What are your plans after the course? </p>

		<p> My plans after this course are to go to University full-time and learn more about a specific IT field that interests me. My end goal would be to find a job that utilises the IT skills that I have learned. </p>

			<h1> My Ideal Job </h1>

			<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> Software Engineer </p>

			<img src="Software Engineer Career Advertisement.png" alt="Screenshot of a software engineer career advertisment">

			<p> A software engineer is someone who creates designs, develops and improves computer programs that we use every day.  This includes applications for businesses, social media, and operating and network systems. </p>

			<p> As a Software Engineer at ‘Lockheed Martin Australia’, I would be providing guidance about software engineering to different stakeholders in the company, be involved in investigations on systematic issues, and designing or re-designing existing systems. </p>

			<p> It would be a job where I would be assisting company workers in doing their job and making systems or existing systems more effective and comfortable to use. I would like to have a job like this because I enjoy finding solutions to problems and building my own programs/systems to help others. </p> 

			<p> The knowledge/experience required for a job like this are: </p>

			<ul>
				
				<li> Python/C and JavaScript programming </li>

				<li> Application development skills in a Linux environment </li>

				<li> User interface development </li>

				<li> Experience in Radar Signal Processing </li>

				<li> Rapid prototyping skills </li>

			</ul>

			<p> I have experience in programming, however, it’s not in these areas. I have done HTML, CSS, and modular programming, but I don’t know how to utilise Python. From my current knowledge I would be able understand how to write with it, but I would need to learn it properly. To learn these skills, I would take further training. </p>

		<h1> Tests </h1>

		<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> M.B.I.T Test </p>

		<img src="M.B.I.T Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of a possible M.B.I.T result">

		<p> My thoughts on the results are that it confirms that I already believe. I am introverted and observant, I think before I do, I am good at weighing up the pros and cons of a situation, and I make my point heard and understood. </p>

		<p> This test result tells me that I behave in certain way. Knowing how I act in teams will help me synergise with other team members; it gives me the information that I can use to work well in teams. </p>

		<p> When I join or create a team, I would like to have people who will get their jobs done and who have a different thinking pattern to me. The reason for this is so everyone in the team can ‘double-check’ what I’m thinking or what others in the team think. </p>

		<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> Learning Style Test </p>

		<img src="Learning Style Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of a possible learning style test Result">

		<p> This was a test on what kind of learner I am. My results are what I’ve thought to be true. I am a visual learner, which means when I learn, I like to use graphs and diagrams and pictures have a better understanding what I’m learning. </p>

		<p> In a team, this means that I prefer diagrams over text or audio-visual information, and I would try to explain to other people my perspective. This also means I would have to listen to auditory learners, give ample time for kinaesthetic learners to get their point across, and make sure I understand a logical learners’ logic.  As a visual person I would also need to stand back and see the whole picture before I made assumptions. </p>

		<p> In a team is good to have people who have different learning styles because they would be different to me, and they would perceive the work from a different angle. </p>

		<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> Motivations and Identities Test </p>

		<img src="Movtivations and Identities Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of possible motivations and identities test result">

		<p> This test was on my motivations and identities. It told me that I was a reward-driven person and that I enjoy solving problems. When I think about these results and how I act, I can see correlations. This was a very informative report on my motivators and identities. </p>

		<p> This test shows that there are five motivator styles: </p>

		<ul>
			
			<li> The Achievers </li>

			<li> The Reward Driven </li>

			<li> The Builders </li>

			<li> The Carers </li>

			<li> The Thinkers </li>

		</ul>

		<p> With these test results in mind, I would create a team that has a variety of different people who can excel in different areas of the team work. For example, a person who is a ‘Thinker’ may enjoy developing the basic groundwork for the team to work from. </p>

		<h1> IT Project Idea </h1>

		<p> This project is to develop an application that assists students with learning difficulties to understand the assessment tasks they are given. This is important for students with difficulties in comprehending instructions and is also useful for schools, particularly those that who have a large number of students. It functions by the student using an E-form template and then displaying the information in various sways to support learning needs, for example, smaller paragraphs for easy reading, or a pink or blue background if necessary. It will be created as an enhancement to existing software that many students already use. </p>

		<p> There are often times when I struggle to understand instructions on assessment tasks. Even through all I have to do is break it down into little pieces, I procrastinate because I do not know the right questions to ask myself that will lead to little pieces, so I don’t start.  Even though I have been working on this for years, the expectations have gotten harder, so I still feel the same overwhelm as I did years ago. </p>

		<p> Unfortunately, this means I end up with less time to do my assignments, and I become stressed and feel less motivated and it goes around and around. And that is just one assessment, when I have lots of different assessments to do for different subjects, I am really difficult to live with. </p>

		<p> I want to be able to work out smaller, more achievable steps that I need to do in order to complete all of my assignments. So that I do not feel overwhelmed, and I can better manage my time. Then I would be less stressed and can do each step to a higher standard. </p>

		<p> It would be useful to not re-invent the wheel and instead enhance a program that schools, like mine and many other schools use, called ‘Day Map’.  There are many project management and process mapping tools, however I would like to tailor these types of programs to this particular problem, because I think a lot of people have the same problem as I do.  </p>

		<p> Not understanding what to do to complete an assignment amongst priorities can make you feel stressed, stupid, and you may think, “I can’t do this.” A way to counter this is to divide all the assessment instructions into smaller paragraphs making the assessment easier to read.  For example, if a student who needs help from a parent or tutor for their work, the helper can use the application to support them and help them keep track of their progress. </p>

		<p> I realise this is a visual solution for someone who is a visual learner. Therefore, this project would be awesome if it was to tackle even one aspect of this problem and develop an interface that can be tailored to auditory, kinaesthetic and logical learning styles. </p>

		<p> An application that can interpret the quality of input into an E-form that the application can then read and provide suggestions for students would be very useful. For example, the teacher creates an assessment and puts it into E-Form, then uploads it to the application. On the students end, they can download the entire E-form and either read it themselves, or click buttons in the application that can answer common questions, such as, “Where do I look for ideas?” or “When is the assessment due?”. The application would also be tracking progress on all tasks. </p>

		<p> This is important and useful for students who have a harder time looking at text information or have trouble with learning without a teacher or family member to help them. With an application like this, students can become more independent in understanding their work, and self-directed learners. </p>

		<p> To create this application, it would need to link into applications that already exist; it would need to add to applications/websites like ‘Day Map’, a school management system, or the R.M.I.T. website. We would need to ask the developers of the targeted system to consider our application for its students who struggle with understanding their work. After that, the application would need to have an overview of what it does and how it works, then it would need to be built in with the same coding language as the application it’s going to add to. It would also need to be tested to see if it has any errors, and if so, they would need to be fixed, and then it can be published. </p>

		<p> Personally, I don’t have any application building skills and I am not an expert in project management. However, what I can do is provide ideas that can aid in the final application. To make the application, I would need to ask the developers what coding they have used for their application and how they want it to be formatted and programmed. The developers would then use the application ideas, program it, and then update it to their application. </p>

		<p> The outcome of continually using this application can result in a student learning how to break down information. It can also teach students how to notice patterns in texts of information, where the topic of a paragraph starts and ends, what is the most important part to acknowledge, etc. Over time, it can become a norm in the development of educational and/or managerial applications. </p>
