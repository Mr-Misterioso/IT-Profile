		<p> Born in Sydney to my Australian/South African mother and my French father.  Other than coding and music I speak English. My hobby is playing the flute, and I have grown up playing with musical groups such as orchestras, flute ensembles, and bands. I am Year 11 at high school and am doing this subject as IT is not offered at my school. This year we moved from the Central Coast NSW to Adelaide and the process has not been easy. </p>

		<p class="questions"> 1.	What is your interest in IT? When did it start? What started your interest? What are your experiences? </p>

		<p> In early high school I chose ICT as electives and I was introduced to different areas of IT. First was robotics and how to use modules to program, next was A.I. and Scratch which both use a similar programming style.  Then I learnt how to use HTML and CSS. I have been intrigued by the different programming styles and their applications in the world ever since. </p>

		<p class="questions"> 2.	What makes IT interesting for you? </p>

		<p> IT has a vast array of purposes. It can be useful for making long distance surgery by operating surgical robots or, to apply for a job. Along with its functions, there are many different forms of code and they are quite versatile.  For example, python can be used to make complex systems or mechanisms, and also in factory processes or business applications. </p>

			<p> A software engineer is someone who creates designs, develops and improves computer programs that we use every day.  This includes applications for businesses, social media, and operating and network systems. </p>

			<p> As a Software Engineer at ‘Lockheed Martin Australia’, I would be providing guidance about software engineering to different stakeholders in the company, be involved in investigations on systematic issues, and designing or re-designing existing systems. </p>

			<p> It would be a job where I would be assisting company workers in doing their job and making systems or existing systems more effective and comfortable to use. I would like to have a job like this because I enjoy finding solutions to problems and building my own programs/systems to help others. </p>

			<ul>
				
				<li> Python/C and JavaScript programming </li>

				<li> Application development skills in a Linux environment </li>

				<li> Experience in Radar Signal Processing </li>

				<li> Rapid prototyping skills </li>

			</ul>

			<p> I have experience in programming, however, it’s not in these areas. I have done HTML, CSS, and modular programming, but I don’t know how to utilise Python. From my current knowledge I would be able understand how to write with it, but I would need to learn it properly. To learn these skills, I would take further training. </p>
