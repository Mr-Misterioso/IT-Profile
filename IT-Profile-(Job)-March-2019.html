			<p> A software engineer is someone who creates designs, develops and improves computer programs that we use every day.  This includes applications for businesses, social media, and operating and network systems. </p>

			<p> As a Software Engineer at ‘Lockheed Martin Australia’, I would be providing guidance about software engineering to different stakeholders in the company, be involved in investigations on systematic issues, and designing or re-designing existing systems. </p>

			<p> It would be a job where I would be assisting company workers in doing their job and making systems or existing systems more effective and comfortable to use. I would like to have a job like this because I enjoy finding solutions to problems and building my own programs/systems to help others. </p> 

			<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> The knowledge/experience required for a job like this are: </p>

			<ul>
				
				<li> Python/C and JavaScript programming </li>

				<li> Application development skills in a Linux environment </li>

				<li> User interface development </li>

				<li> Experience in Radar Signal Processing </li>

				<li> Rapid prototyping skills </li>

			</ul>

			<p> I have experience in programming, however, it’s not in these areas. I have done HTML, CSS, and modular programming, but I don’t know how to utilise Python. From my current knowledge I would be able understand how to write with it, but I would need to learn it properly. To learn these skills, I would take further training. </p>
