		<p class="subtitle"> M.B.I.T Test </p>

		<img src="M.B.I.T Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of a possible M.B.I.T result">

		<p> My thoughts on the results are that it confirms that I already believe. I am introverted and observant, I think before I do, I am good at weighing up the pros and cons of a situation, and I make my point heard and understood. </p>

		<p> This test result tells me that I behave in certain way. Knowing how I act in teams will help me synergise with other team members; it gives me the information that I can use to work well in teams. </p>

		<p> When I join or create a team, I would like to have people who will get their jobs done and who have a different thinking pattern to me. The reason for this is so everyone in the team can ‘double-check’ what I’m thinking or what others in the team think. </p>

		<p class="subtitle"> Learning Style Test </p>

		<img src="Learning Style Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of a possible learning style test Result">

		<p> This was a test on what kind of learner I am. My results are what I’ve thought to be true. I am a visual learner, which means when I learn, I like to use graphs and diagrams and pictures have a better understanding what I’m learning. </p>

		<p> In a team, this means that I prefer diagrams over text or audio-visual information, and I would try to explain to other people my perspective. This also means I would have to listen to auditory learners, give ample time for kinaesthetic learners to get their point across, and make sure I understand a logical learners’ logic.  As a visual person I would also need to stand back and see the whole picture before I made assumptions. </p>

		<p> In a team is good to have people who have different learning styles because they would be different to me, and they would perceive the work from a different angle. </p>

		<p class="subtitle"> Motivations and Identities Test </p>

		<img src="Movtivations and Identities Test Result.png" alt="Screenshot of possible motivations and identities test result">

		<p> This test was on my motivations and identities. It told me that I was a reward-driven person and that I enjoy solving problems. When I think about these results and how I act, I can see correlations. This was a very informative report on my motivators and identities. </p>

		<p> This test shows that there are five motivator styles: </p>

		<ul>
			
			<li> The Achievers </li>

			<li> The Reward Driven </li>

			<li> The Builders </li>

			<li> The Carers </li>

			<li> The Thinkers </li>

		</ul>

		<p> With these test results in mind, I would create a team that has a variety of different people who can excel in different areas of the team work. For example, a person who is a ‘Thinker’ may enjoy developing the basic groundwork for the team to work from. </p>
