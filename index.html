		<p> I was born in Sydney, my mother is Australian and my father was French, and we spoke English at home. My hobby is playing the flute, and I have grown up playing with musical groups such as orchestras, flute ensembles, and bands. <br> <br> I am in Year 11 at high school and I am enrolled in this subject as IT is not offered at my school. This year we moved from the Central Coast in NSW to Adelaide SA. </br> </br> </p>

		<p class="questions"> 1.	What is your interest in IT? When did it start? What started your interest? What are your experiences? </p>

		<p> In early high school I chose ICT as electives and I was introduced to different areas of IT. First was robotics and how to use modules to program, next was A.I. and Scratch which both use a similar programming style.  Then I learnt how to use HTML and CSS. I have been intrigued by the different programming styles and their applications in the world ever since. </p>

		<p class="questions"> 2.	What makes IT interesting for you? </p>

		<p> IT has a vast array of purposes. For example, surgery can now be performed via robots remotely. It can also be useful for managing schedules, and I can even tune a guiter with a eletronic tuner. Along with its functions, there are many different forms of code and they are quite versatile.  For example, python can be used to make complex systems or mechanisms, like those in factory lines or business applications. </p>

		<p class="questions"> 5.	What are your plans after the course? </p>
